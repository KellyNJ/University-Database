Tables in the Diagram:
- takes
- student
- advisor
- department
- instructor
- prereq
- course
- time_slot
- teaches
- classroom
- section
* 11 tables total


Tables missing in the University DB:
- advisor
- time_slot
- classroom
* Missing 3 tables


Three tables need to be created:

advisor:
s_id
i_id

time_slot:
time_slot_id
day
start_time
end_time

classroom:
building
room_number
capacity

Syntax improvement:
- drop table <INSERT TABLE NAME> --> drop table if exists <INSERT TABLE NAME>

Needed changes to adapt DB:
* Objective: To complete the University DB -- all relations should be added with foreign key constraints based on the diagram (Slide 9)
- Add the 3 tables stated above
- Add FKCs to enforce referential integrity
